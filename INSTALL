2. To create a deb package, just run "./src/packages/linux/make_deb.sh" in source root. After installation of it, you will find item "Контакты" at your app menu.
3. To build manually, run following:

  qmake -r virtus.pro INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr DEFINES+=USE_PHONON
  make
  sudo make install

Then you can run "ramblercontacts" from terminal.

First, you have to download Growl.framework (version 1.3+) and Sparkle.framework and cp them to /Library/Frameworks/.
Then run following commands:

  qmake -r virtus.pro CONFIG+=release CONFIG-=debug CONFIG-=debug_and_release DEFINES+=USE_PHONON
  make
  make install

This will create Contacts.app at /Applications/.
