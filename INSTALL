* Common

You need Qt version > 4.7.0, but there are some issues with Linux build on 4.8.0.

* Linux

1. Dependency list: openssl, libqtwebkit-dev | libqt4-dev, libx11-dev, zlib1g-dev, libidn11-dev, libxss-dev, curl
2. To create a deb package, just run "./src/packages/linux/make_deb.sh" in source root. After installation of it, you will find item "Контакты" at your app menu.
3. To build manually, run following:

  qmake -r virtus.pro INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr DEFINES+=USE_PHONON
  make
  sudo make install

Then you can run "ramblercontacts" from terminal.

* Mac OS X

First, you have to download Growl.framework (from Growl SDK version 1.3+) and Sparkle.framework and cp them to /Library/Frameworks/.
Then run following commands:

  qmake -r virtus.pro CONFIG+=release CONFIG-=debug CONFIG-=debug_and_release DEFINES+=USE_PHONON
  make
  make install

This will create Contacts.app at /Applications/.

If you want to create a distributable version run ./src/packages/macosx/make_bundle.sh from sources root.
To autocreate .dmg image file run ./src/packages/macosx/make_dmg.sh

* Windows
